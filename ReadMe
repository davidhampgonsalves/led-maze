## To do

* breaks if you play for awhile?

* spawn is kind of agressive
* sometimes you can go through a square without triggering it?
* final levels + final song
* does win work?

* secret exit to bonus level? - hard code exit location and send you to different level

* level end init gets called twice and causes the score count bug
